I will let you guys know via snapchat groupchat on what needs to be done by each of you. You will have a deadline so please try to stick to it as delays may restrict someone else from doing their tasks. I will comment the general logic and flow of the code and then try to implement it. Any questions, just send them in snapchat groupchat. 

I WILL MAKE UPDATES REGULARLY FROM NOW ON TO COMMUNICATE MORE EFFECTIVELY AS THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK ON.

  So I've just been debugging and trying to correct the logic in the previous commit of Ismaeil. Ismaiel you got a lot done and most of the flow was great so good job. Just a few areas seemed abit rushed and required changes. The finalize order function logic should be a     bit different and the add user to order logic should be implemented. It is my fault for not properly clarifying the specificities. Areeba is working on flowchart of UI's and logic to help clarify and make it easier for us to collaborate and work together. Ismaiel I want    you to get started on implementing user password system. You will need to add a String password attribute to the user class and initialise any random passwords for the already instantiated user objects. Then when the user is chosen we prompt for their password. Any         questions, message in the snapchat groupchat.

  We need to implement the shared user logic and also test current features to make sure that everything is working as intended. Areeba will be working on creating tests for us.
