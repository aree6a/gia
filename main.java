        // loop for user to keep adding items, warning when exceeding budget and when exceeding balance. add the item to the users item list.
        // also prompt user to add shared items (potentially after adding their normal items). add the item to the users shared items.
        // we would also need to keep track of who they want to share it with so we can add it to their items too.

        // exit loop once user finishes adding items and then either start a new loop for next user or allow finalisation.
        // we repeat this until max number of users have done it which we will just hardcode to number of users we initialise.
        // we need to make sure we track every user who has participated to the order, we do this by adding them to the list of participants in Order class.

        // after they press finalisation, we need confirmation from each user that was a part of the order. to simulate this we will simply display their order, associated costs,
        // balance before and after, and say "username do you accept"
        
        // we do this for each user and then once all have confirmed we will "submit" the order
